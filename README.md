# shootemup1
This project was a quick attempt at making a side scrolling shooter game with joystick controls and reusable projectiles.  This is certainly not a full game but demonstrates how to set up a scrolling shooter in Unity.  I created the artwork for the spaceship, background, and joystick and fire buttons.

The joystick on the right moves your spaceship in a clamped environment on the left hand side of the screeen.  The Green button is fire laser, red button is fire bomb (not implemented).  The alien spaceship is just a target to check collision detection with the lasers.

This would be a good start for a shoot-em-up but is mostly intended to be a quick tech demo.  I made this in about a day and a half in Unity.  C# scripts.  Unity editor 2019.2.10f1.
